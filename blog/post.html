                    <p>In this paper I will argue that I’m not oppressed as a student. While I belong to an institution that molds me, I benefit from systematic forces as a result of my membership to this institution. Molding is one facet of oppression, but alone is not sufficient. In addition, oppression also requires students to be systematically reduced and immobilized through their status as a student. Certainly, some critics argue that students are reduced and immobilized because college is both stressful and expensive, and thus allowing for potential exploitation of the student. I argue these critics are mistaken because this suffering does not come as a result of systematic oppression directed towards college students. When observed macroscopically, the system of interrelated forces works to benefit students by molding them into professionals. To begin, I will consider Iris Young’s discussion on powerlessness as a criteria for determining whether students are oppressed.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                    <p>In order to determine whether reduction and immobilization is a result of systematic oppression aimed at college students, we first consider Frye’s approach to isolated tools used to oppress, and their relation to the larger oppressive structure: “One has to look at how the barrier or force fits with others and to whose benefit or detriment it works“(Frye, 11). In other words, structural oppression involves relations among groups. On one hand we have students and on the other we have non-students. Students are professionals because it increases one’s class position by entering into a professional practice. As a result, graduated students unintentionally benefit from the exploitation of non-educated, non-professional workers. Thus, “professionals are privileged in relations to nonprofessionals by virtue of their position in the division of labor” (Young, 52). Most students attend college to receive an education which will yield a greater number of career opportunities in a professional practice which would not be available to them without training in a specialized knowledge.</p>

                    <blockquote> The best part of every man’s education is that which he gives to himself.</blockquote>

                    <p>If students are molded into professionals by the educational apparatus, then they benefit from the exploitation of the nonprofessional workers. While education does work to shape and manipulate one’s life, it is simultaneously enriched by exposure to new interests, tools and resources to cultivate these interests, and connections for students to construct professional careers paths. Those non-students that don’t pursue specialized knowledge, however, are forced into an inferior position in the divisions of labor. It should be observed that the interrelating forces of the educational apparatus work to the student’s advantage by providing specialized knowledge, and a rewarding career performing mental work. Subsequently, these forces work to non-students disadvantage since they lack specialized knowledge to advance their position in the division of labor from manual labor to mental labor. As a result, this oppression has distributive consequences such that college graduates earn about twice as much money than those with a high school diploma.
                    In response, critics might argue that students aren’t always rewarded with professional jobs, and instead are bogged down from the injustices inherent in the system.</p>

                    <p>Firstly, the claims made in concern to oppression are not universal, and are not used to describe a structure. So for Olivia’s individual’s case, the barrier confronting her is not part of a system of oppression against students.  While college is a pricey, and for some an unpleasant experience, which can be a cause of great pain and suffering, the barriers in place certainly do not immobilize nor reduce students. Structural oppression requires one to consider the relations with others. Students causally contribute to the system by their enrollment to further intensify the divisions of labor. Moreover, while I am molded as a student, I am also provided with credentials which helps me find a professional career tailored to my specialized interest. Thus, I am not reduced through this molding: receiving an education doesn’t leave one powerless in the hands of the after mentioned apparatus. Being a non-student, i.e, an. unprofessional worker, on the other hand, is significantly attached to</p>
